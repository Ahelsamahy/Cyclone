# Why
This project is inspired by the old arcade game Cyclone (nostalgia♥), I made it as implementation to use C++ in Arduino back in February 2020.

(it was also excuse for me to tell my teacher that I can code better in C++ so I don't have to do more assignments )

# Rules
There are 10 led and two buttons on the board, 8 green LEDs in the middle and one red LED with one button on each side, the light goes from one side to the other one with speed of 30ms for each one, the goal of the game is to press the button while the the red LED on your side is on, once you reach 5 points the score will reset again to zero.
When you score, the 5 LEDs (4 green and 1 red) on your side will blink for how many points you have.

# How-to
These are the component that you will need to make it. <p align="center">

</p>
I made an A-Z tutorial of how to assemble a small box that would be good for the job on **[Instructables][1]** .
